#### A bad esoteric interpreter for a esoteric language written in a bad language.

To finish off the comic sans font, rotating output box and the lack of instructions, we put the code on a Tablet Server.
That's right, an old Android tablet emulating Ubuntu running a simple Apache web-server and a Cloudflare API script 
to keep up with the rapidly changing IP address. We do not expect it to be working for above a 50% live rate, so good luck.

It's even wireless and has a built in UPS!

Don't even try to use this and kill us already.
